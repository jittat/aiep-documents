## AI-Integrated Engineering Program (AIEP)

The **AI-Integrated Engineering Program (AIEP)** at Kasetsart University prepares students to become future-ready engineers who can blend core domain expertise with artificial intelligence (AI). It includes both 4+1 fast-track options and standalone Master's programs.

###  Academic Offerings

####  Bachelor + Master (4+1)

AIEP program is a fast-track pathway that lets students complete both degrees in five years. During the first three years, students take courses in their chosen field of engineering along with foundational courses in artificial intelligence. In the fourth year, they begin graduate-level coursework and undertake an engineering project related to their thesis topic. In the fifth year, they continue with the [AI-Integrated Engineering](/docs/master/ai-integrated) program.

####  Master’s Degrees

Currently, the department offers a graduate-level master’s program:

- [M.Eng. in Computer Engineering](/docs/master/computer/) is a program for students interested in advanced learning and research in computer engineering

In addition, the department is developing the following program:

- [M.Eng. in AI-Integrated Engineering](/docs/master/ai-integrated/) is designed to produce graduates with expertise in a specialized engineering field alongside knowledge and skills in artificial intelligence.


4+1 students who meet eligibility requirements may transition directly to the Master’s phase.
