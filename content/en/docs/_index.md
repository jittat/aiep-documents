## AI-Integrated Engineering Program (AIEP)

The **AI-Integrated Engineering Program (AIEP)** at Kasetsart University prepares students to become future-ready engineers who can blend core domain expertise with artificial intelligence (AI). It includes both 4+1 fast-track options and standalone Master's programs.

###  Academic Offerings

####  Bachelor + Master (4+1)

A fast-track pathway that lets students complete both degrees in five years:
- [Explore 4+1 Programs](/docs/4plus1/)

####  Master’s Degrees

- [M.Eng. in AI-Integrated Engineering](/docs/master/ai-integrated/)
- [M.Eng. in Computer Engineering](/docs/master/computer/)

> 4+1 students who meet eligibility requirements may transition directly to the Master’s phase.
