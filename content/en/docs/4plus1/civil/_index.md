AI-Integrated Civil Engineering is a next-generation academic track co-developed by the Department of Civil Engineering and the Department of Computer Engineering at Kasetsart University.

It prepares students to become civil engineers who don't just build structures — but design intelligent, sustainable, and human-centered systems for the cities of tomorrow.  

Students will gain hands-on experience in smart construction, geospatial analysis, structural monitoring, environmental prediction, and infrastructure design using real-world data and cutting-edge AI tools.
