##  What is the 4+1 Program?

The **4+1 Pathway** is a fast-track academic structure that allows qualified undergraduate students to continue seamlessly into the **Master of Engineering in AI-Integrated Engineering**, completing both degrees within five years.

-  **4 years** in your home department (e.g., Mechanical, Civil, Environmental, etc.)  
-  **1 extra year** to complete the AI-Integrated Master’s degree  
-  Integrated coursework, capstone, and research planning  
-  Saves time and tuition while preparing you for AI-driven innovation

---

##  Why Choose the 4+1 Program?

This pathway ensures that:

-  **You maintain full professional depth** in your core engineering field  
    - You will graduate from your home department (e.g., Civil, Chemical, Mechanical) as a full-fledged engineer.
-  **You gain real, hands-on AI expertise**  
    - Not just using tools — you will **build models, write code, and solve real problems** under guidance from AI experts in Computer Engineering.
-  **You upgrade your profile** to match the demands of the modern engineering workforce  
    - AI-literate engineers are in high demand across all fields — from energy and manufacturing to infrastructure and smart cities.
-  **You enjoy interdisciplinary learning**  
    - Study and collaborate across departments with peers from different AI+X Engineering tracks.

##  How It Works

| Year | Study Focus |
|------|-------------|
| 1–3  | Core undergraduate coursework in your home department |
| 4    | Undergraduate capstone project with AI integration + AI core electives |
| 5    | Master’s-level AI courses + thesis or industrial project |

---

##  Who Is This For?

- Students who are **ambitious** and want to go beyond a traditional B.Eng.
- Those who want to **lead AI transformation** in their industries
- Learners who want to **combine engineering with data, algorithms, and intelligence**

---

##  Admission to Year 5 (Master’s)

To continue into the Master's year, you must:

- Meet GPA and academic readiness requirements  
- Complete required undergraduate AI electives  
- Propose a capstone project aligned with your master's thesis or applied AI project  

Admission is **selective and competitive**, ensuring that only committed students proceed.

---

##  Long-Term Benefits

-  Dual credential: B.Eng. (your major) + M.Eng. (AI-Integrated Engineering)
-  High employability in AI + Engineering roles
-  Opportunities in smart cities, advanced manufacturing, robotics, and sustainability sectors
-  Smooth transition into Ph.D. or research roles (if desired)
