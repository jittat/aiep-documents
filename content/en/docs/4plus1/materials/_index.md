> **AI-Integrated Materials Engineering** is a pioneering program co-developed by the Department of Materials Engineering and the Department of Computer Engineering at Kasetsart University.  
> It is designed to produce a new generation of engineers who understand that materials are the foundation of all engineering innovations — from smartphones and electric vehicles to spacecraft and next-generation batteries — and who can harness AI to unlock the full potential of these materials.

> KU students will gain hands-on experience analyzing real production data, applying machine learning to predict component failures, and developing projects based on real-world challenges from industries such as energy, electronics, semiconductors, and smart manufacturing.

> Throughout the program, students are mentored by expert faculty from both disciplines and collaborate with peers from other AIEP tracks — such as Mechanical, Industrial, and Environmental Engineering — fostering a truly interdisciplinary learning experience.
