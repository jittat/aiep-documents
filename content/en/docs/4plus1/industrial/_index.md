> **AI-Integrated Industrial Engineering** transforms the industrial engineering profession for a world where algorithms automate decisions, optimize systems, and coordinate workflows. Graduates will not just improve existing processes; they will co-create future-ready operations using artificial intelligence, data, simulation, and digital twins as key tools. 

> Built on operations research, supply chain management, manufacturing systems, and human factors—and expanded with machine learning, simulation, and intelligent automation—students will lead changes in factories, warehouses, logistics networks, and service sectors like healthcare, finance, e-commerce, travel, and public services. From real-time scheduling and predictive inventory to human-in-the-loop decision systems, artificial intelligence becomes the primary toolkit.

##  What You'll Learn

Students will build strong foundations in industrial engineering, including deterministic and stochastic operations research, production and inventory management, facility layout, queueing theory, ergonomics and safety. These core competencies provide the essential framework for understanding and optimizing complex systems and processes.

The program develops artificial intelligence and data capabilities through programming for data analysis, time-series modeling and anomaly detection, supervised and unsupervised machine learning, and reinforcement learning for scheduling and control. Students learn to leverage these technologies to enhance traditional industrial engineering methods with intelligent automation and predictive analytics.

Students will master simulation and digital twins through discrete-event and agent-based simulation, twin-driven experimentation, and stress testing of policies. The curriculum covers optimization at scale, including mixed-integer programming, constraint programming and decomposition, heuristics and metaheuristics, and robust and risk-aware planning techniques.

The program emphasizes decision intelligence through predict-then-optimize workflows, causal reasoning, development of key performance indicators and dashboards, explainability, and human-in-the-loop systems. Students learn responsible deployment practices including data governance, model validation, controlled experiments (A/B testing), monitoring, and lifecycle management.

Additionally, students will specialize in service systems, covering service design and queueing networks, skill-based routing and analytics for contact centers, appointment and surge-capacity planning in healthcare, dynamic pricing and revenue management, customer-journey and churn analytics, service quality engineering, and service-level commitments.
